    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Baked rice is so easy to make and requires minimal ingredients. Swensen used to be our favourite restaurant to go for baked rice until I realized that it is actually very easy to make them at home and it is so much more value for money as compared to eating them outside!</p>
    <p>The recipe can have so many variations to it. Sometimes I even add in some Japanese curry roux cubes to make a curry version of baked rice. You can even swap the rice for spaghetti or instant noodles! I guarantee you that your kids (and adults too) will definitely love this fun and easy recipe!</p>
